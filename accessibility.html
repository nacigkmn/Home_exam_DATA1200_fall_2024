        <h1>Accessibility</h1>

        <h2>Design</h2>
         
        <p>Accessibility was the most focused points while we were creating our project. Principles of universal design was our guide lines to create a most possible user friendly web design. Therefore we tried to apply seven design principles (Equitable use, flexibility use, simple and intuitive use, perceptible information, tolerance for error, low physical effort and appropriate size and space for approach and use). We used variety of sources to get deeper knowledge about these principles and one of them was reachable <a class="source" href="https://www.buffalo.edu/access/help-and-support/topic3/universaldesignprinciples.html">here.</a></p>
      

        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>
            All images are downloaded free image providing websites. Links are in a text document named â€œimage references which can be found in "Image" folder. 
        </p>
            
        <h2>Code structure</h2>
        <p>
            We tried to write understandable and clear code through the project. Project has least possible files and all of them easy to read. At the beginning we create one css file for each html files. In addition to that we thought it could better to create separate @media css and layout css which includes shared codes for each page (such as menu bar, body background, text plains and footer.) But this increased amount of files in four project more than double. So we decided to create one css file where all sections are separated with comment lines. We believe that all codes in css file is neat and easy to find. 
        </p>

        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>
            We tested our project by some discussions with people who has more experience about web development. We gathered critics and information and tried to apply them to our project if its possible. If it was not possible to apply idea direct we focused on how to adapt idea to our project or how can we adapt our project to idea. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally we ran google lighthouse test. Here in the image first test results of our index page are visible on the image. Rest of the pages were also tested and many fails were fixed. 
        </p>
            
        <div class="result-box">
            <div class="result">
                <img src="Images/BeforeFix1.jpg" alt="First test results" class="test1">
                <p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Insuficient accessibility</p>
            </div>
            <div class="result">
                <img src="Images/BeforeFix2.jpg" alt="First test results" class="test2">
                <p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> ESO results were also not good enough</p><br>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Last part of our web development project we paid attention to fix those mistakes. Although we manage to fix many of them, unfortunately we weren't able to make some changes. But we learned that testing procedures must take place from the beginning of project not only at the end. Last test results of our index page are on image below. 
        </p>
        <div class="last-result">
            <img src="Images/AfterFix.jpg" alt="Test results after fail fixing" class="test3">
            <p>
                <strong>Figure 3:</strong> Results er quite sufficient after fixing fails
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <h1 class="title">Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Our web project is user friendly and simple. Esthetic sides can be relative and criticized. Code is neat, easy to understand and modify for to use it possible feature projects.</p>
